# LangGraph Practice Project

**Mastering Agentic Workflows with LangGraph**

This project is dedicated to exploring and implementing advanced AI agents using **LangGraph** and **Google Gemini**. By building stateful, multi-actor applications, I am diving deep into the world of agentic design patterns.

## Tech Stack
- **LangGraph**: For building stateful, multi-actor applications with LLMs.
- **LangChain**: The foundation for LLM orchestration.
- **Google Gemini**: Powering the intelligence behind the agents.
- **Python**: Core programming language.

## Project Structure
- `landgraf_graph.ipynb`: Main experimentation notebook where the logic resides.
- `utils/`: Reusable helper functions for visualization and data processing(pretty print messages).
- `.env`: Securely managing API credentials.

## Learning Goals
- Understand cyclic graphs and state management in AI workflows.
- Implement conditional routing and error handling in multi-step processes.
- Experiment with human-in-the-loop patterns for reliable agent performance.
